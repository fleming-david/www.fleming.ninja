    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>To chnage the directory used just edit the inputDir and outputDir in the python file. Be sure to have a "features" and "matches" folder in the output folder or images will not be save. It might also be a good idea to change the ThreadPool constructor to a different thread count depending on the number of CPU core (n + 1). Also keep not, for the perpose of getting examples some of the filenames are hardcoded on the findMatch function call, this should be changed as well.</p>
    <h4>Reasoning</h4>
    <p>The use of KNN matching instead of plan matching helped to limit the number of matches to the top candidates and then using the Lowe's Ratio Test with a ratio of .75 narrowed down the false possitives further. The choice of .75 was a result of trial and error, anything lower did not match some clear keypoints and and anything higher matched points that did not make sense.</p>
